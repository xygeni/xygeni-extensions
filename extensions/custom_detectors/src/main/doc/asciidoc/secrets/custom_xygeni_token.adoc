== Description

Xygeni is a platform for improving the Software Supply Chain Security posture for organizations.

This detector looks for the JWT Token used for authentication.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) represent claims securely between two parties. They follow the open standard https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[RFC 7519].

JWT are JSON objects containing the claims and signed using HMAC or public key/private keypair. It contains three parts: a header, a payload and a signature. header and payload are base-64 encoded JSON objects.

== Security

Any _hardcoded Xygenio.io Token_ is a potential secret reported by this detector.

Accidentally checking-in the key to source control repositories could compromise your Xygeni.io account, allowing an external person to access your supply chain vulnerabilities information.

== Mitigation / Fix

. Follow your policy for handling leaked secrets, which typically require revoking the secret in the target system(s).
+
Go to the https://in.xygeni.io/dashboard/configuration-panel/profile[Settings/Profile] page, `Access tokens` section. Look for the token to revoke, and then create a new one with the same permissions as the leaked token (note the token value to replace references to the old token), and then click the `Delete` icon on the right side of the leaked token.
+
Replace references to the old token with the new one.

. Remove the leaked token from the source code or committed configuration file. This is optional, as the leaked token is not valid anymore.

. Instead of hard-coding the xygeni token, you should use an alternative mechanism for retrieving the new token, as documented in https://docs.xygeni.io/xygeni-products/secrets-security/secret-leaks-handling/how-to-prevent-hard-coded-secrets[How to Prevent Hard-Coded Secrets].

[TIP]
====
Never share a `xygeni.yml` configuration file with a valid token. It is a secret. It is better to use a reference to an environment variable or local file. like  or `file:path/to/token/file`. The scanner will read the value from an environment variable `${XYGENI_TOKEN}`, or from a local file reference `file:path/to/token/file`, like `file:~/xygeni.token` (in the file path, `~/` will be replaced by the user home directory). In a CI/CD pipeline you can safely pass sensitive values as environment variables using a CI/CD secret.

If hard-coded in the configuration file, you can encrypt the token to protect it against casual readers, using `xygeni util encrypt`. See https://docs.xygeni.io/xygeni-scanner-cli/xygeni-cli-overview/cli-utils/credentials-encryption[Credentials Encryption] for further details.
====

[CAUTION]
====
You should consider any sensitive data in commits with secrets as *compromised*.

Remember that secrets may be removed from history in your projects, but not in other users' cloned or forked repositories.
