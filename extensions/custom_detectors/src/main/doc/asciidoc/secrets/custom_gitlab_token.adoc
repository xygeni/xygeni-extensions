== Description

A GitLab https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html[Personal Access Token] are an alternative to OAuth2 authentication, used to authenticate a user with the GitLab API and with git using HTTP basic auth.

They are required when two-factor authentication (2FA) is required.

== Security

Any _hardcoded GitLab token_ reported by this detector is a potential security issue. Although they expire and have limited https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#personal-access-token-scopes[scopes], when leaked attackers may use them to perform unintended actions on GitLab projects managed by the user, with the privileges granted for the token.

== Examples

[code,]
-----
GL_TOKEN = glpat-SNixgZ5e6NWeo1Wwga11

== Mitigation / Fix

. Follow your policy for handling leaked secrets, which typically require revoking the secret in the target system(s). Revocation is documented https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#revoke-a-personal-access-token[here].

. Remove the token from the source code or committed configuration file. If under a git repository, you may remove unwanted files from the repository history using tools like `git filter-repo` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner`. You may follow the link:https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/1090[procedure listed here for GitLab]. Anyway, always consider the token as compromised and revoke it.

. Check access logs to ensure that the secret was not used by unintended actors during the compromised period. GitLab displays the last used date in the profile under link:https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens[`User Settings > Access Tokens`].

. Additional controls can help mitigate future leaks. Setting appropriate link:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#personal-access-token-scopes[token scopes] may reduce what threat actors may do with a leaked token. In addition, the link:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/access_and_permissions.html[Group access and permissions] for Premium/Ultimate tiers may be used for client IP whitelisting.
