# Overview 

This project aims at extending the Xygeni platform for End to End Software Supply Chain Security. 

This repository help partners and end-users to share their own extensions and to request for new ones, that could be added to the platform or even provided here for the community.

The repository contains documentation and examples for Xygeni extensions, including:

- custom detectors,
- activity sensors,
- third-party report ingest, 
- guardrail and workflow actions.

# How to...

The following sections document how to add a custom component to the Xygeni platform, in a way that it could be shared with other users.

## Create a custom detector

A detector is a piece of logic that detects an issue in the scanned system like source code, a source code repository or a container image, a CI/CD system or another software tool. A detector has an implementation class and a YAML file configuring the detector and providing documentation for the issues created by the detector.

Read [Developing Custom Detectors](https://docs.xygeni.io/xydocs/developers/custom_detectors.html) for full documentation.

## Create a guardrail or workflow action

TBD

## Create a report loader for a third-party tool

Xygeni prioritization and response can be also used with security findings reported by third-party security tools (namely external scanners), both open-source and commercial. The scanner provides a report-upload command for uploading the structured reports generated by third-party security tools, in areas like Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Software Composition Analysis (SCA), or Secret Leaks / IaC Flaws Detection.

The `report-upload` framework is available with the scanner so new converters for unsupported formats could be added. Go to the [Report Upload](extensions/report_upload/README.md) section for full details on how to add a new tool format.

## Create an activity sensor for a software system

TBD


## Exporting reports

Xygeni exporters are shared to allow third-party tools to provide data in a format that Xygeni can ingest. 

### Kiuwan SAST Exporter

As a complement to Kiuwan SAST converter available in the Xygeni `report-upload` tool, here is an example of how to export the findings from Kiuwan.

Kiuwan is a powerful, end-to-end application security platform. Kiuwan Static Application Security Testing (SAST) product is the tool that detects security vulnerabilities in source code using static analysis.

The problem is that Xygeni does not provide a mechanism in the agent (Kiuwan Local Analyzer) for writing to a local file the findings from the tool.

To export the findings to a local file for uploading into third-party tools like Xygeni, the approach used was to register the custom rule [ExportRule](src/main/java/ext/kiuwan/ExportRule.java) provided that registers a task to export the findings at the end of the analysis.

See [Kiuwan Exporter](kiuwan/README.md) for full details on how to register the exporter in your Kiuwan account, and to upload exported reports from Kiuwan into Xygeni using the `report-upload` command.

### Sonarqube SAST Exporter

As a complement to Sonarqube SAST converter available in the Xygeni `report-upload` tool, here is an example of how to export the findings from Sonarqube (Server and Cloud) by using the Sonarqube Web API.

See [Sonarqube Exporter](extensions/exporter/sonarqube/README.md) for details.

# Contributing
